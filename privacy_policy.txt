Shappy Secretary — Privacy & Consent (in-app)

Short summary:
Shappy Secretary assists you with calls, messages, reminders, and daily organization. The assistant stores sensitive data locally and only performs sensitive actions when you explicitly allow them.

What data we may access and why:
- Microphone: to detect the wake word and process voice commands. Audio is processed locally wherever possible.
- Voiceprint (optional): stored encrypted on your device to verify it's you.
- Contacts & Call state: to identify callers and provide call screening.
- Notifications: to read and triage incoming notifications and e-mails.
- Calendar & Email: only with your explicit OAuth consent.
- Recordings: disabled by default. If enabled, visible indicators are shown and consent is required.

Your controls:
- Toggle voiceprint training on/off; retrain or delete at any time.
- Toggle call recording (defaults off). App requires you to confirm legal consent.
- Revoke all permissions with the “Revoke & Clear Data” action.
- Export logs in encrypted format.

Legal note:
You are responsible for complying with local laws about call recording and conversation monitoring.
